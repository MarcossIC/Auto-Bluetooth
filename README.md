# Auto-Bluetooth
This repository contains the code to operate a four-wheeled car with Arduino, and Bluetooth connection.

## How to use
Because the code is simple but simply functional, you need to download the code, then compile it with the Arduino IDE and that's it.
The materials I used to make it work are an RC-00 Bluetooth module and an Arduino Uno board, basic motors and an improvised chassis.
